# Climate Impact Labeling
Climate Impact Labeling is a web application built to inform consumers about food product purchases and their impact on green house gas (GHG) emissions. Users search food products by name or by barcode (GTIN/UPC) and are provided nutritional information along with an emission rating of low/moderate/high that pertains to a products contribution to green house gases. 

In addition to GHG emissions, the application also informs consumers about other agricultural impacts such as land usage, acidification, eutrophication, and freshwater withdrawals. While energy accounts for the majority of emissions, food production is also a major contributor accounting for 26% of global GHG emissions that we the consumers can influence through our choices. 

Product information and nutritional data were obtained via the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agriculutrual Research Service. [Food Data Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)

Data pertaining to a food products agricultural impact and GHG emissions were obtained from the work published by J.Poore and T.Nemecek in the journal of Science. [Reducing foodâ€™s environmental impacts through producers and consumers](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987)
