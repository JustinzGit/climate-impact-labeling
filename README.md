# Climate Impact Labeling
Climate Impact Labeling is a web application built to inform consumers about food product purchases and their impact on green house gas (GHG) emissions. Users search food products by name or by barcode (GTIN/UPC) and are provided an emission rating of low/moderate/high. Users are also provided nutrition data and data pertaining to a products agricultural impact. This includes a products land usage, acidification, eutrophication, and freshwater withdrawals. While energy accounts for the majority of emissions, food production is also a major contributor accounting for 26% of global GHG emissions that we the consumers can influence through our choices. 

Product information and nutritional data were obtained via the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agriculutrual Research Service. [Food Data Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)

Data pertaining to a food products agricultural impact and GHG emissions were obtained from the work published by J.Poore and T.Nemecek in journal of Science. [Reducing foodâ€™s environmental impacts through producers and consumers](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987)
